## Git Commit Conventions

```
- 🎉 :tada: initial commit 🎉
- 🚀 :rocket: [Add] when implementing a new feature
- 🔨 :hammer: [Fix] when fixing a bug or issue
- 🎨 :art: [Refactor] when refactor/improving code
- 🚧 :construction: [WIP]
- 📝 :pencil: [Minor] Some small updates
```

## Git Branch Naming Conventions

```
- New feature: feature/feat_name
- Bug: bug/bug-bugId
- Documentation: doc-oct11-jira-ticket-number

## How to run a project

```
    Use below command to run project based on your requirment
    - For development debug: flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev
    - For development release: flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev --release
    - For production debug: flutter run -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod
    - For production release: flutter run -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod --release
```

## How to generate apk/ipa for project

```
    Use below command to generate apk/ipa of project based on your requirment
    - For development apk: flutter build apk -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev --release
    - For development ipa: flutter build ipa -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev --release
    - For production apk: flutter build apk -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod --release
    - For production ipa: flutter build ipa -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod --release
```

## How to manage flavor

```
    Go thorugh https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b link to understand how flavor is managed in flutter
```

## Constants

- Define all constants in `lib/utils/enums.dart`
- Define all keys in `lib/utils/keys.dart`
- Define all text constants in `lib/utils/texts.dart` (If not using the localization)

## Images

- Define all images in XXX

## Themes

- Application theme is present in XXX. Modify or add new theme there and use your new theme in XXX

## Fonts

- You can change default font of whole app in themes. To add new font, place font in XXX, add font family in pubspec.yaml and create font entry in XXX

## Localization

- You can add localization to the app by adding .json files in XXX folder. .json files are based on JSON and define standardised ways on how to add more information around key-value pairs. More key-value pairs can be added to the already present .json files. The AppLocalizations class is set on compile time and one can access the keys directly.

## Directory Structure

```bash

```

## Firebase Authentication

#### Google

- To perform firebase google authentication, you just need to call `performGoogleSignIn()` function of `AuthServiceImpl` class which is kept under `lib/data_services/auth`. This function will handle the google sign-in. After successful sign in, it will also call a service to register the device platform with FCM Token.
- Service call :`registerDevicePlatform()`: is written in 'DeviceService' class which can be found in `lib/data_services/device`.
- [Google Sign-In](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) : Pub package used for google sign in.

#### Twitter

- `signInWithTwitter()` method of `LoginProvider` class initiate Twitter Login and from it `performTwitterLogIn()` of `AuthServiceImpl` class will be called which performs login for mobile and Web.
- Created private method name `_processUserDetails()` in `AuthServiceImpl` class to reduce code redundancy. This method process the login response and returns the user object.
- Twitter API key and Secret key are added into `AllKeys` class as a static value.
- [Twitter Log-In](twitter_login: ^4.0.1) : Pub package used for Twitter log in.

## User Sign-up

- There will be basically 2 types of users in Luminary (Normal users, Advisors).

#### `Normal User (who seeks for advice)`
- If user has selected to become a normal user of the application on on-boarding page, then it will be navigate to create its profile as normal user `who won't be having any advisor privileges`.
- Normal user sign consists of less mandatory information.

#### `Advisor (who will provide advises and answer the queries)`
- If user has selected to become an advisor in the application on on-boarding page, then it will be navigate to create its profile as Advisor user.
- Advisor will have all privileges in the application. Here, Verification of email and phone number is mandatory to add for proceeding to create profile. Also Other required information needs to filled out by the user to become an advisor such as languages, expertise, his/her education related information and also advisor can add its social media handles (url) at the time of creating profile.
- Most of the information in this profile creation section is mandatory and must be verified as application want their advisors to be verified.
***

## Home Page
- Once user logs in the application post creating the profile, he will be navigated to Home page.
- Home page will bottom navigation bar from which user can move to different features.

From home page, user can move to 5 different screens.

## 1. Home Page
   - *home page content description goes here*

## 2. Search
   - *search page content description goes here*

## 3. Advice
   - All the queries which was sent/received by the user will be displayed in the page.
   - `For Normal User` : All queries sent by the user will be displayed here.
   - A normal user can view the status of his/her asked questions and also they can view the answer if the query is responded by advisor.
   - `For Advisor` : All queries sent by the user as well as the queries which are asked by someone to the user will be displayed here.
   - An advisor can also send queries to someone as a normal user, but he will get the list the queries which was asked by someone to him, he can then respond/reject/retract the request accordingly.
   - Users can also `save/bookmark` the queries if they want from here.
   - Feature of sorting & filtering the list is also available to the user.

 #### Technical Documentation
- `Sent` and `Received` are the tabs in the screen. In `initState()`,if the array is not null, then it will fetch it from backend using `_getSentQuestions()` method, which will add the advice/content to the provider's list : `sentQuestions` incase of Sent tab and `receivedQuestions` incase of received tab. Also their respective response will also be saved for pagination and display information purpose.
- `_getReceivedQueries()` is the method which will fetch received queries data from backend and store it in `AdviceProvider`.
- Data wont be re-fetched if user plays around with bottom bar tabs. It will only be fetched if provider's list is null and user wants to refresh by pulling down the list view.
- Pagination feature is also been added in Sent and Received queries cases. The scrolls and fetching of datas are managed by `RefreshIndicator` widget's `notificationPredicate` param, `_onSentQuestionsScrollNotification` & `_onReceivedAdviceScrollNotification` methods will be the value of the param which will control sent questions and received queries data fetching from backend after checking if is there any more data to be fetched.

#### Advice Provider
   - `getSentQuestions()` -> It will fetch the questions sent by the user.
   - `getReceivedQuestions()` -> It will fetch the queries someone asked to the user.
   - `isThereMoreSentQuestions` -> Returns bool after checking if more sent questions data is there to fetch.
   - `isThereMoreReceivedAdvices` -> Returns bool after checking if more received queries data is there to fetch.
   - `markQuestionAsRead()` -> Service call to mark the questions as read (it will only be in case if the logged-in user is an advisor).
