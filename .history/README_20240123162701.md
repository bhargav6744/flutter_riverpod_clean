## Constants

## Themes

## Fonts

- You can change default font of whole app in themes. To add new font, place font in XXX, add font family in pubspec.yaml and create font entry in XXX

## Localization

- You can add localization to the app by adding .json files in XXX folder. .json files are based on JSON and define standardised ways on how to add more information around key-value pairs. More key-value pairs can be added to the already present .json files. The AppLocalizations class is set on compile time and one can access the keys directly.
