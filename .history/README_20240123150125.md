## How to run a project

```
    Use below command to run project based on your requirment
    - For development debug: flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev
    - For development release: flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev --release
    - For production debug: flutter run -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod
    - For production release: flutter run -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod --release
```

## How to generate apk/ipa for project

```
    Use below command to generate apk/ipa of project based on your requirment
    - For development apk: flutter build apk -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev --release
    - For development ipa: flutter build ipa -t lib/main_dev.dart --flavor dev --release
    - For production apk: flutter build apk -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod --release
    - For production ipa: flutter build ipa -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod --release
```

## How to manage flavor

```
    Go thorugh https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b link to understand how flavor is managed in flutter
```

## Constants

- Define all constants in XXX
- Define all keys in XXX
- Define all text constants in XXX (If not using the localization)

## Images

- Define all images in XXX

## Themes

- Application theme is present in XXX. Modify or add new theme there and use your new theme in XXX

## Fonts

- You can change default font of whole app in themes. To add new font, place font in XXX, add font family in pubspec.yaml and create font entry in XXX

## Localization

- You can add localization to the app by adding .json files in XXX folder. .json files are based on JSON and define standardised ways on how to add more information around key-value pairs. More key-value pairs can be added to the already present .json files. The AppLocalizations class is set on compile time and one can access the keys directly.

## Directory Structure

## Project Feature Documentation


 #### Technical Documentation
- `Sent` and `Received` are the tabs in the screen. In `initState()`,if the array is not null, then it will fetch it from backend using `_getSentQuestions()` method, which will add the advice/content to the provider's list : `sentQuestions` incase of Sent tab and `receivedQuestions` incase of received tab. Also their respective response will also be saved for pagination and display information purpose.
- `_getReceivedQueries()` is the method which will fetch received queries data from backend and store it in `AdviceProvider`.
- Data wont be re-fetched if user plays around with bottom bar tabs. It will only be fetched if provider's list is null and user wants to refresh by pulling down the list view.
- Pagination feature is also been added in Sent and Received queries cases. The scrolls and fetching of datas are managed by `RefreshIndicator` widget's `notificationPredicate` param, `_onSentQuestionsScrollNotification` & `_onReceivedAdviceScrollNotification` methods will be the value of the param which will control sent questions and received queries data fetching from backend after checking if is there any more data to be fetched.

#### Advice Provider
   - `getSentQuestions()` -> It will fetch the questions sent by the user.
   - `getReceivedQuestions()` -> It will fetch the queries someone asked to the user.
   - `isThereMoreSentQuestions` -> Returns bool after checking if more sent questions data is there to fetch.
   - `isThereMoreReceivedAdvices` -> Returns bool after checking if more received queries data is there to fetch.
   - `markQuestionAsRead()` -> Service call to mark the questions as read (it will only be in case if the logged-in user is an advisor).
